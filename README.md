## tide-forecast 

### Objective

Go [here](https://www.tide-forecast.com/) to get tide forecasts for these locations:

  - Half Moon Bay, California
  - Huntington Beach, California
  - Providence, Rhode Island
  - Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina

Load the tide forecast page for each location and extract information on low tides that occur after sunrise and before sunset. Return the time and height for each daylight low tide.

### Install 

Make sure you have [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Clone the repository and `npm i`

### Start

`npm start`

This should print the output in the terminal window and write the daylight low tides to the json files in the output directory (there's sample output already there).

### Test

`npm test`
